# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

dnscrypt-proxy: dnscrypt-proxy (OpenDNS Secure DNS Utility)
dnscrypt-proxy:
dnscrypt-proxy: The DNSCrypt protocol is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on
dnscrypt-proxy: securing communications between a client and its first-level
dnscrypt-proxy: resolver. While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the
dnscrypt-proxy: local network (which is often the weakest link in the chain) against
dnscrypt-proxy: man-in-the-middle attacks. It also provides some confidentiality to
dnscrypt-proxy: DNS queries.
