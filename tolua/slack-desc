# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tolua: tolua (C/C++ Tool for Lua)
tolua:
tolua: tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++
tolua: code with Lua. Based on a cleaned header file, tolua automatically
tolua: generates the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using
tolua: Lua API and tag method facilities, tolua maps C/C++ constants,
tolua: external variables, functions, classes, and methods to Lua.
