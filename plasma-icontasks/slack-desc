# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

plasma-icontasks: This is a modified version of the KDE taskbar, and taskmanager
plasma-icontasks: library. The main change is to preserve the position of tasks
plasma-icontasks: and launchers. e.g. when a launcher is activated, the resultant
plasma-icontasks: task item appears in the same place in the taskbar as the
plasma-icontasks: launcher did.
