# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libiec61883:
libiec61883: The libiec61883 library provides an higher level API for streaming DV,
libiec61883: MPEG-2 and audio over IEEE1394.  Based on the libraw1394 isochronous
libiec61883: functionality, this library acts as a filter that accepts DV-frames,
libiec61883: MPEG-2 frames or audio samples from the application and breaks these
libiec61883: down to isochronous packets, which are transmitted using libraw1394.
