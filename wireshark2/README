Wireshark network protocol analyzer

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or "sniffer". It lets you
capture packet data from a live network, or read packets from a
previously saved capture file, either printing a decoded form of
those packets to standard output or writing the packets to a file.
Wireshark's native capture file format is libpcap format, which is
also the format used by tcpdump and various other tools.

Wireshark GUI
=============
Enable GTK+3 GUI by default. Tested. Worked.
GTK3_GUI="yes"

Disable Qt4 GUI by default. Still crashed in my system. Maybe because Qt5 installed?
QT4_GUI="no"

Enable Qt5 GUI. Requires qt5 (alienBob kde5 has it). Disable by default.
QT5_GUI="no"

Example for building Qt5 GUI: QT5_GUI="yes" ./wireshark.SlackBuild
