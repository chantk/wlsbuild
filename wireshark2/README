Wireshark network protocol analyzer

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or "sniffer". It lets you
capture packet data from a live network, or read packets from a
previously saved capture file, either printing a decoded form of
those packets to standard output or writing the packets to a file.
Wireshark's native capture file format is libpcap format, which is
also the format used by tcpdump and various other tools.
