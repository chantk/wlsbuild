# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libevent: libevent (Event Notification Library)
libevent:
libevent: The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
libevent: when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
libevent: has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to
libevent: signals or regular timeouts. libevent is meant to replace the event
libevent: loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs
libevent: to call event_dispatch() and then add or remove events dynamically
libevent: without having to change the event loop.
