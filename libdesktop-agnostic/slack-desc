libdesktop-agnostic: Desktop Agnostic Library
libdesktop-agnostic:
libdesktop-agnostic: This library provides an extensible configuration API, a unified
libdesktop-agnostic: virtual file system API, and a desktop item editor (all with pluggable
libdesktop-agnostic: backends) for GLib-based projects. It is not tied to any one desktop
libdesktop-agnostic: environment, although there are desktop-specific modules.
