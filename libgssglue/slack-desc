# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libgssglue:
libgssglue: This library exports a gssapi interface, but doesn\'t implement any
libgssglue: gssapi mechanisms itself; instead it calls gssapi routines in other
libgssglue: libraries, depending on the mechanism.
