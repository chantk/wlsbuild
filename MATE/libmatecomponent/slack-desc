libmatecomponent: libmatecomponent (MATE Non-GUI Component)
libmatecomponent:
libmatecomponent: libmatecomponent is the non-GUI part of the matecomponent component
libmatecomponent: infrastructure, it is most useful for creating aggregate interfaces &
libmatecomponent: doing IPC easily. It also contains a rather badly designed &
libmatecomponent: implemented per-system activation system. This needs re-writing &
libmatecomponent: simplifying to be per-display.
