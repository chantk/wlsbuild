# The default tmpfs size for /run in slackware is 32MB. It is not sufficient if
# the login user is using /run/user as their XDG directory and maybe their TMP
# dir too. There is no recommended size, but 20% of the actual memory sounds good.
# But I think 16G (from 64G / 4) is too much just for a TMP.
# Size suffix should be none if size is in bytes, or K, M, G.
#
# Lets start with 200M or 20% of 1G memory as in generic VPS
#RUN_SIZE="200M"
#
# Or we can set the divider value. Default to 5 (20% of RAM)
#DIV_SIZE="8"
