# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

x86cpucaps:
x86cpucaps: x86cpucaps is a library, which investigates CPU information using
x86cpucaps: 'cpuid' in assembler. This library can detect CPU IDs (Family-Model-
x86cpucaps: Stepping), vendor name strings ("GenuineIntel", "AuthenticAMD", and so
x86cpucaps: on), and SIMD capabilities. Furthermore, there are functions,
x86cpucaps: estimating optimal Processor Type (for building kernel), and
x86cpucaps: estimating optimization flags for gcc.
