# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

futures: The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for
futures: asynchronously executing callables. The asynchronous execution can
futures: be performed with threads, using ThreadPoolExecutor, or separate
futures: processes, using ProcessPoolExecutor. Both implement the same
futures: interface, which is defined by the abstract Executor class.
