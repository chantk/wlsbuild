# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

nvtt: nvtt (NVidia Texture Tools)
nvtt:
nvtt: The NVIDIA Texture Tools is a collection of image processing and
nvtt: texture manipulation tools, designed to be integrated in game tools
nvtt: and asset conditioning pipelines. The primary features of the library
nvtt: are mipmap and normal map generation, format conversion and DXT
nvtt: compression. DXT compression is based on Simon Brown's squish library.
nvtt: The library also contains an alternative GPU-accelerated compressor
nvtt: that uses CUDA and is one order of magnitude faster.
