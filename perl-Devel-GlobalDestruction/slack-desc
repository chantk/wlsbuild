# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Devel-GlobalDestruction: Perl's global destruction is a little tricky to deal with WRT finalizers
perl-Devel-GlobalDestruction: because it's not ordered and objects can sometimes disappear. Writing
perl-Devel-GlobalDestruction: defensive destructors is hard and annoying, and usually if global
perl-Devel-GlobalDestruction: destruction is happening you only need the destructors that free up non
perl-Devel-GlobalDestruction: process local resources to actually execute. For these constructors you
perl-Devel-GlobalDestruction: can avoid the mess by simply bailing out if global destruction is in effect.
