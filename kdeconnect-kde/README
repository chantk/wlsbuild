kdeconnect-kde (KDE Connect for Android)

KDE Connect is a project that aims to communicate all your devices.
For example, with KDE Connect you can receive your phone notifications
on your computer, or just use your phone as a remote control for your
desktop. To achieve this, KDE Connect implements a secure
communication protocol over the network, and allows any developer
to create plugins on top of it.
