subunit: subunit (C bindings for subunit)
subunit:
subunit: Subunit is a streaming protocol for test results.  The protocol is a
subunit: binary encoding that is easily generated and parsed.  By design all the
subunit: components of the protocol conceptually fit into the xUnit TestCase ->
subunit: TestResult interaction.
subunit: Subunit comes with command line filters to process a subunit stream and
subunit: language bindings for python, C, C++ and shell.  Bindings are easy to
subunit: write for other languages.
