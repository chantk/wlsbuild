# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-gtk2: perl-gtk2 (PERL Module)
perl-gtk2:
perl-gtk2: Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ widget set. This module
perl-gtk2: allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish and
perl-gtk2: object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management
perl-gtk2: in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.
