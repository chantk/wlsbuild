# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

fping:
fping: fping is a ping(1)-like program which uses the (ICMP) echo request
fping: to determine if a host is up. fping is different from ping in that
fping: you can specify any number of hosts on the command line, or specify
fping: a file containing the lists of hosts to ping.
