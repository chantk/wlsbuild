# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

eio: Eio integrates with EFL (Ecore, Eina) to provide efficient filesystem

eio: like using at-variants, splice, properly handling errors and doing it
eio: in an asynchronous fashion by means of worker threads. Whenever you
eio: need to list a directory, copy, move or delete files, Eio will do that
eio: task better than you'd achieve with naive implementations, and it is
