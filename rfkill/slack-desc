# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

rfkill:
rfkill: The rfkill subsystem provides a generic interface to disabling any
rfkill: radio transmitter in the system. When a transmitter is blocked, it
rfkill: shall not radiate any power. The subsystem also provides the ability
rfkill: to react on button presses and disable all transmitters of a certain
rfkill: type (or all). This is intended for situations where transmitters need
rfkill: to be turned off, for example on aircraft.
