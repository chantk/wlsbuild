# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

presentproto:
presentproto: The Present extension provides a way for applications to update
presentproto: their window contents from a pixmap in a well defined fashion,
presentproto: synchronizing with the display refresh and potentially using a more
presentproto: efficient mechanism than copying the contents of the source pixmap.
