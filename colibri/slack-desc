# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

colibri: colibri (KDE4 Plasma Notifications)
colibri:
colibri: Colibri provides an alternative to KDE4 Plasma notifications. Colibri
colibri: notifications look lighter and are completely passive: they do not
colibri: provide any buttons. Since they are completely passive, they smoothly
colibri: fade away when you mouse over them, allowing you to interact with any
colibri: window behind them. They also do not stack each others: if multiple
colibri: notifications happen, they will be shown one at a time.
