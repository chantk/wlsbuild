# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libcheck: libcheck (C Unit Test Framework)
libcheck:
libcheck: Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface
libcheck: for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the
libcheck: developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can
libcheck: catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation
libcheck: faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within
libcheck: source code editors and IDEs.
