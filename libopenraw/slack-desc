# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libopenraw: libopenraw (Decode camera RAW files)
libopenraw:
libopenraw: libopenraw is an ongoing project to provide a free software
libopenraw: implementation for camera RAW files decoding. One of the main reason is
libopenraw: that dcraw is not suited for easy integration into applications, and
libopenraw: there is a need for an easy to use API to build free software digital
libopenraw: image processing application.
