# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libconfig: libconfig (C/C++ Configuration File Library)
libconfig:
libconfig: Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration
libconfig: files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML.
libconfig: And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
libconfig: parsing in application code. The library includes bindings for both
libconfig: the C and C++ languages. It works on POSIX-compliant UNIX systems
libconfig: (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, FreeBSD) and Windows (2000, XP and later).
