# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xnoise: xnoise is a media player with a slick GUI, great speed and lots of
xnoise: features. But Unlike Rhythmbox, Banshee or iTunes, xnoise uses a
xnoise: tracklist centric design. The tracklist is a list of video or music
xnoise: tracks that are played one by one without being removed. This gives
xnoise: you the possibility to enqueue any track in any order, regardless if
xnoise: they are on the same album or not.
