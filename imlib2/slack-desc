# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

imlib2:
imlib2: Imlib 2 is the successor to Imlib. It is NOT a newer version --
imlib2: it is a completely new library. Imlib 2 can be installed alongside
imlib2: Imlib 1.x without any problems since they are effectively different
imlib2: libraries which have very similar functionality.
