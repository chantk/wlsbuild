# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libdbusmenu-gtk:
libdbusmenu-gtk: A small little library that was created by pulling out some comon code
libdbusmenu-gtk: out of indicator-applet. It passes a menu structure across DBus so
libdbusmenu-gtk: that a program can create a menu simply without worrying about how it
libdbusmenu-gtk: is displayed on the other side of the bus.
