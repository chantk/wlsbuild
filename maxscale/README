MaxScale needs mysql/mariadb static lib for building.
No need to reinstall/upgrade already installed mysql/mariadb. We just need the
static libmysqld.a. Please rebuild mysql/mariadb using Slackware's SlackBuild
like this:

KEEPSTATIC="YES" ./mysql.SlackBuild
-OR-
KEEPSTATIC="YES" ./mariadb.SlackBuild

Now we can build maxscale like this:

DBUSE="mysql or mariadb" DBVER="mysql/mariadb version" ./maxscale.SlackBuild

After maxscale build finished, you can delete mysql/mariadb build directories
to save some space because it does using a lot of space (around 2.5 GB).
